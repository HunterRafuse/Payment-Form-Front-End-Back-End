# Payment-Form-Front-End-Back-End
Little payment form created with Stripe API, PHP and MySQL


## To begin
this little project is heavily PHP orientated. If you don't know too much about PHP I recommend beginning with functions, loops and
object coding. 

Functions & Arrays:
http://php.net/join

Classes:
http://php.net/dir

While and For loops:
http://php.net/while

OOP, Object Oriented Programming:
http://php.net/oop

# Now that we covered the basics:
Make sure you have PHP 7 installed.
